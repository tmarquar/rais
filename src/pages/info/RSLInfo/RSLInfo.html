  <h2>Regional Screening Levels</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>What are SLs? </strong> <br>
    The screening levels (SLs) presented on this site are developed
    using risk assessment guidance from the EPA Superfund program
    and can be used for Superfund sites. They are risk-based
    concentrations derived from standardized equations combining
    exposure information assumptions with EPA toxicity data. SLs are
    considered by the Agency to be protective for humans (including
    sensitive groups) over a lifetime; however, SLs are not always applicable
    to a particular site and do not address non-human health endpoints,
    such as ecological impacts. The SLs contained in the SL table are generic;
    they are calculated without site-specific information. They may be
    re-calculated using site-specific data.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Why are SLs used? </strong> <br>
    They are used for site "screening" and as initial cleanup goals,
    if applicable. SLs are not de facto cleanup standards and should
    not be applied as such. The SL's role in site "screening" is to
    help identify areas, contaminants, and conditions that require
    further federal attention at a particular site. Generally, at
    sites where contaminant concentrations fall below SLs, no further
     action or study is warranted under the Superfund program, so
     long as the exposure assumptions at a site match those taken
     into account by the SL calculations. Chemical concentrations
     above the SL would not automatically designate a site as "dirty"
     or trigger a response action; however, exceeding a SL suggests
     that further evaluation of the potential risks by site contaminants
     is appropriate. SLs are also useful tools for identifying initial
     cleanup goals at a site. In this role, SLs provide long-term targets
     to use during the analysis of different remedial alternatives. By
     developing SLs early in the decision-making process, design staff
     may be able to streamline the consideration of remedial alternatives.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>How do SLs differ from cleanup standards? </strong> <br>
    SLs are generic screening values, not de facto cleanup standards.
    Once the Baseline Risk Assessment (BLRA) is completed, site-specific
    risk-based remediation goals can be derived using the BLRA results.
    The selection of final cleanup goals may also include (Applicable or
    Relevant and Appropriate Requirements (ARARs) and to be considered
    guidance (TBCs), as well as site-specific risk-based goals.
    <br> <br>
    In the Superfund program, this evaluation is carried out as part
    of the nine criteria for remedy selection outlined in the National
    Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP). Once
    the nine-criteria analysis is completed, the SL may be retained as
    is or modified (based on site-specific information) prior to
    becoming established as a cleanup standard. This site-specific
    cleanup level is then documented in the Record of Decision.
