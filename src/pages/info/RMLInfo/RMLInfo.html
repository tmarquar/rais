  <h2>Regional Removal Management Levels</h2>
  <p>
  <strong> What are RMLs? </strong> <br>
  The Regional Removal Management Levels (RMLs) presented
  on this site are to support the decision for EPA to undertake
  a removal action under CERCLA. They are risk-based, although
  not necessarily protective for long term exposures,
  concentrations derived from standardized equations combining
  exposure assumptions with toxicity data from the Superfund
  program's hierarchy. The RMLs contained in the RML table are
  generic. In other words, they are calculated without
  site-specific information (e.g., the time-frame over which
  individuals may have been exposed to site contaminants).
  However, this website links to the Regional Screening Levels
  (RSLs) calculation tool which allows for the use of
  site-specific data to modify the generic RMLs.
</p>
<p>
  <strong> How are RMLs used? </strong> <br>
  RMLs help identify areas, contaminants, and conditions where
  a removal action may be appropriate. Sites where contaminant
  concentrations fall below RMLs, are not necessarily “clean,”
  and further action or study may be warranted under the Federal
  Superfund program. In addition, sites with contaminant
  concentrations above the RMLs may not necessarily warrant a
  removal action dependent upon such factors as background
  concentrations, the use of site-specific exposure scenarios
  or other program considerations.
