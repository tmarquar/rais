Welcome to the "Regional Screening Levels for Chemical Contaminants at Superfund Sites" screening level/preliminary remediation goal website.
This website was developed with DOE's Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) under an Interagency Agreement as a merger of the EPA Region 3 RBC Table,
 Region 6 HHMSSL Table and the Region 9 PRG Table. The RSL website is now the source of screening levels for all the EPA regions. The RSL tables
 provide comparison values for residential and commercial/industrial exposures to soil, air, and tapwater (drinking water). The unified use of the RSLs,
  to screen chemicals at Superfund sites, promotes national consistency. Here you will find tables of risk-based screening levels, calculated using the
   latest toxicity values, default exposure assumptions and physical and chemical properties, and a calculator where default parameters can be changed
   to reflect site-specific risks. To ensure proper use of the screening level tables and the calculator, please review the What's New, User's Guide,
   Frequent Questions, and Download Area links. Below is a general description of screening levels for chemical contaminants. If the calculator is
    used with non-default inputs in a decision on a Superfund site, it is recommended that the inputs be clearly identified and justified by the user.

  <h1 class="pagetitle">Introduction</h1>
  <p>
    Superfund sites are addressed under the authority of the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
    Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980, which was amended by the 1986 Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act.
     The purpose of this website is to provide a screening level calculation tool to assist risk assessors, remedial project managers,
     and others involved with risk assessment and decision-making at CERCLA sites in developing or refining screening levels.
