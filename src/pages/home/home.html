  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>
    to the "Regional Screening Levels for Chemical Contaminants at Superfund
    Sites (RSL)" and "Regional Removal Management Level (RML)" screening level app. This app was developed with
    DOE's Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) under an Interagency Agreement. The RSLs area now
    the source of screening levels for all the EPA regions. The RSLs and RMLs provide comparison
    values for residential and commercial/industrial exposures to soil, air, and tapwater (drinking water).
    The unified use of the RSLs, to screen chemicals at Superfund sites, promotes national consistency.
     The RSLs and RMLs are calculated with the same models using the latest toxicity values,
     default exposure assumptions, and physical and chemical properties. To ensure proper use of the RSLs,
     review the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/risk/regional-screening-levels-rsls-whats-new">What's New</a>,
